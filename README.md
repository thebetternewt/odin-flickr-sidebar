## Odin Flickr Sidebar

A Ruby on Rails application completed for [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com) to further learn to access the Flickr API. (And to learn about accessing APIs in general.) Followed a tutorial on how to create a Flickr sidebar on [pixellatedvisions.com](http://www.pixellatedvisions.com/2009/04/06/integrating-flickr-into-your-rails-website).

## Lessons Learned

This application shows my initial understanding of working with an API and building a form to submit a request to that API to retrieve data and update a view.
